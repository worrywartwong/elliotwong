        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frances Brann grew up in England where she studied Fine Art at West of England College of Art in Bristol, and has since both taken and taught classes in Alaska and California.  She then moved to Delta Junction in Interior Alaska, where she built two houses, had a custom woodworking shop, exhibited serigraphs, wood block prints, drawings and gallery furniture.
        </p>
        <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seventeen years in Alasks she spent the next three years sailing with her family from Alaska through the south pacific on Snow Dragon, a small sail boat, eventually reaching Australia.
        On her return to the US her next project was to build a 49 foot aluminium cutter, which was launched after just two and a half years.  Snow Dragon II is now a wonderful home and studio that can take her anywhere in the world.
She currently has a mobile woodworking business building interiors for fine yachts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been working in watercolor since 2000.  Though a demanding medium I feel it wonderful.  The transparent quality makes the colors so vibrant, though at the same time it makes watercolor so unforgiving.  The way the wet paint runs and moves around on the paper is very challenging because it's something that can be directed and enjoyed but never really controlled.  
The planning for my watercolor paintings is more like the planning for a print than oil or acrylic painting."
        <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My work is based on drawings from observation, which are then combined and manipulated before being transferred to watercolor paper.  
I believe the unsurpassed color intensity and fluid, jewel like quality of the paint make watercolor the ideal medium for my vibrant and slightly surreal paintings."
        </p>
        <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've enjoyed making these paintings and hope my vision of the world makes you happy or intrigues you, and perhaps makes you think as well.  
I welcome your comments on both the paintings and the website, so please <a href="contact.html"> contact me</a>. "
